uber-go-style-linter
====================

Devolpment status: **alpha**

Why another linter?
-------------------

At Uber, we have a few extra style preferences that aren't enforced by the
standard tooling. We find that this style minimizes bugs and encourages best
coding practices. If you don't work at Uber, you can safely ignore this.

What does it do?
----------------

- [x] Enforce underscores for globals
- [ ] Nothing else, yet
